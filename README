This is a copy of the source found at http://code.google.com/p/dune2themaker/.

I suggest using git-svn to synchronize between the SVN based development at
code.google.com and this GIT repository.

The aim of this repository is to:

1) Provide a sane build system for 'Dune 2 - The Maker'.

2) Remove cruft (stuff that does not belong into a VCS).

3) Integrate whatever distros need.

4) Hopefully merge those changes back.
